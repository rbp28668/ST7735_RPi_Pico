ST7735S

PIN 22, GPIO17 (SPIO-CS) -> CS
PIN 24, GPIO18 (SPIO-CLK)-> SCL
PIN 25, GPIO19 (SPIO->TX)-> SDA
PIN 26, GPIO20 -> RES
PIN 27, GPIO21 -> DC
PIN 31, GPIO26 ->  BLK


From demo code and datasheet:

Chip select = active low.
Command set RS is 0, data RS is 1
Data clocked in on rising edge
clock idle is high (may not matter)
Bytes transmitted MS bit first
2 byte data - command is 1, data transmitted high byte first.  CS stays low for complete 16 bit transfer.
Looking at data sheet (and behaviour) you can't transfer a 16 bit quantity as 2 8 bit quanties with CS
being de-asserted (i.e. going high for a bit) in the middle.
